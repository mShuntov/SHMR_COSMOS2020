This directory contains the measurements of galaxy clustering (2pt angular correlation function) and the galaxy stellar mass function. Each folder contains the measurements in a different redshift bin that corresponds to the name of the folder. In each folder there is the SMF measurement and the angular correlation function w_LL for different stellar mass threshold selected sample. The log10 of the stellar mass threshold is indicated in the filename.
